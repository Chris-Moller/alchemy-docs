### Note for Windows users

If you're on Windows, all of the below instructions will work for you on the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) (WSL). WSL gives you the Linux experience without making you log off your Windows OS. So most linux commands will work on a WSL terminal as well.

So before you can follow along any of the below instructions, please [install WSL](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu/9PDXGNCFSCZV?hl=en-in\&gl=IN) from the Microsoft App store, and then go to the "Start" menu to open the app named "Ubuntu," to access the Ubuntu terminal from your Windows OS.

**Note:** Command Prompt will work in most cases, but some Linux commands are not supported.\

{% endhint %}

### Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

#### Visual Studio

Visual Studio is one of the leading IDEs used by a spectrum of developers, not just Web3.&#x20;

Visual Studio's in-platform terminal, extensibility for new languages and great UI, make it a perfect IDE for all developers, and the most popular IDE today.

[Download Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your OS (available for Windows, Linux and Mac), and then install it.

#### Remix

If you want to save yourself from the hassle of setting up your environment and get started right away - Remix is the web3 IDE tool for you.&#x20;

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online all-integrated IDE that lets you test, deploy and execute smart contracts from the comfort of your browser tab.

And don't forget to [add Alchemy as your Custom RPC provider](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/guides/connecting-metamask-to-alchemy).

### Development Frameworks and Languages

#### Node and npm

Node.js is a Javascript runtime that serves as the base layer for many web-based projects.&#x20;

Npm is a package manager to download and update packages for your Node.js ecosystem.&#x20;

Both are typically crucial to manage packages and develop seamlessly in web3.

To set up node, [download and install the correct version for your OS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Below commands will work for all Linux, MacOS and Windows. [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) (Recommended) and Command Prompt can be used on Windows.
{% endhint %}

To verify your installation you can type below commands in your Terminal and hit enter.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

if you see a version number (for instance `14.0.1`) node and npm are now installed in your system.

To install the latest version of npm, you can do:

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

#### React and Next.js

React and Next are development frameworks which make it super easy for a developer to get started with developing applications.&#x20;

React and Next.js come with packaged tools and configured files, which reduces the developer's effort to just writing code instead of managing the environment as well earlier.

{% hint style="info" %}
Below commands will work for all Linux, MacOS and Windows. [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) (Recommended) and Command Prompt can be used on Windows.
{% endhint %}

If not already installed, you can install react using the below command:

```bash
npm install react
```

Then you can create a react app with the below command:

```bash
npx create-react-app sampleApp
```

To install next.js, run the below command:

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

### Local Web3 Development Environment

#### Hardhat

Hardhat is the de-facto local Ethereum development environment.&#x20;

Hardhat makes it very easy for web3 developers to:

* Deploy and test on specific [Ethereum and EVM-compatible testnets](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-are-testnets) like Mumbai and Goerli&#x20;
* Deploy smart contracts and test on Hardhat's local network
* Deploy on Ethereum mainnet and other blockchains using JSON-RPC providers like [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com)
* Use [blockchain developer tools](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/20-blockchain-development-tools) like Waffle, Etherscan and Ganache via built-in plugins

While we recommend using Hardhat, other local ethereum environments include:

* [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/)&#x20;
* [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Below commands will work for all Linux, MacOS and Windows. [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) (Recommended) and Command Prompt can be used on Windows.
{% endhint %}

To install hardhat in your systems, you can run the following:

```bash
npm install â€“save-dev hardhat
```

When you want to create a Hardhat project in a specific directory, you can run:

```bash
npx hardhat
```

### Ethereum Libraries

#### Ethers.js

Ethers.js is one of the most common Ethereum libraries used by developers to interact with the Ethereum mainnet and Ethereum testnets via code.&#x20;

[Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) has readily available and easy to use functions to deploy contracts, execute smart contract methods, send ethereum etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
Below commands will work for all Linux, MacOS and Windows. [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) (Recommended) and Command Prompt can be used on Windows.
{% endhint %}

To install ethers, you need to run the below:

```bash
npm install --save ethers
```

To import the library in your javascript code (React or Next.js) you can write:

```javascript
import {ethers} from "ethers";
```

### Wallet

#### Metamask

Metamask is one of the most [common browser-based blockchain wallets](https://www.alchemy.com/web3-wallets-overview) used within the Web3 ecosystem, and blockchain application developers use it to test, build and deploy dApps.&#x20;

Web3 consumers use MetaMask to store and manage their crypto assets, and interact with web3 applications, and use DeFi apps.

Here are some helpful [tutorials to set up your MetaMask wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNPz-Dv5BjM) and [how to add Alchemy as an RPC endpoint](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/guides/connecting-metamask-to-alchemy) to your Metamask which will make your transactions faster and easier to manage.

{% hint style="info" %}
Metamask is currently supported only on Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Brave. It is not supported on Safari.
{% endhint %}

### Block Explorer

#### Etherscan

Etherscan is an [online block explorer](https://etherscan.io/) (no installation needed) where users can search transaction hashes, contract addresses or EOA's and it will return all the info for that address/hash on a page.&#x20;

Block explorers are helpful web3 developer tools when you need to see the status of a recently submitted transaction or the details of a smart contract.

Each testnet has their own block explorers. The most popular ones are:

* [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)
* [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/)
* [Rinkeby (deprecated)](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)

Similarly, other chains and L2's have their own explorers:

* &#x20;[Polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/)
* [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/)
