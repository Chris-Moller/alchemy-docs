### 1. :chart\_with\_upwards\_trend: Increase User Engagement

Increases user engagement and retention by improving overall UX dramatically.

### 2. :heavy\_check\_mark: Easy Integration

### 3. :mag\_right: Rich Developer Insights

Get access to all of the events your users care about, like mined and dropped transactions, plus powerful webhooks to instantly notify you when these events happen.

## :tired\_face: Problem: Notifications don't exist in blockchain

* UX and lack of relevant notifications is one of the biggest inhibitors to the growth of blockchain apps.
* Getting the information required to notify users about web3 events is complicated and requires large amounts of dev time and extra infrastructure.
* Itâ€™s impossible for developers to trigger notifications for important events like dropped transactions.

## :smiley: Solution: Alchemy Notify

Alchemy Notify enables you to send relevant, timely notifications on the most important Web3 events with the following benefits:

* Starts working with a two-click creation process, doing all the hard work for you.
* Has built in notifications for mined transactions, dropped transactions and smart contract events.

## Features

### :pick: [Mined Transactions](../../enhanced-apis/notify-api/using-notify.md#mined-transactions)

Let your users know exactly when their deposits, purchases, in-game actions or other on-chain activity has officially occurred â€” the perfect time to re-engage and keep using your application.

### :hole: [Dropped Transactions](../../enhanced-apis/notify-api/using-notify.md#dropped-transactions)

Let your users respond immediately when transactions fail, eliminating the most frustrating part of blockchain UX. No more missed trades, lost auctions, or disappearing tokens.

### :money\_with\_wings: [Address Activity](../../enhanced-apis/notify-api/using-notify.md#address-activity)

Let your users know when transaction activity occurs on their address. No more refreshing the page or having to watch each new block and create custom filters to track userâ€™s data. The Address Activity webhooks include notifications for:

1. [External Transfers](../../enhanced-apis/notify-api/using-notify.md#types-of-transfers)
2. [Internal Transfers](../../enhanced-apis/notify-api/using-notify.md#types-of-transfers)
3. [Token Transfers](../../enhanced-apis/notify-api/using-notify.md#address-activity)
