# 10. How to Create a Decentralized Twitter with Lens Protocol

In this tutorial, you're going to learn **how to develop and deploy an ERC721 (NFT)** smart contract using **Alchemy, OpenZeppelin, Remix, and Ethereum Rinkeby.**

In this lesson, you will learn:

* How to set up a Next.js app with an Apollo GraphQL client
* How to use the Lens protocol API to fetch profiles, posts, and other data stored on the Polygon blockchain
* An introduction to the MintKudos API -- so that you can integrate your PoK tokens in your dapp!
* An introduction to Lit Protocol -- in case you want to encrypt certain posts to only be shown to various community members
* How to deploy your decentralized social media app frontend website using Repl.it

Here is a Github Repo with an example of the finished project in case you need it to follow along: \<tbd>

Let's get started!

(Video version coming soon!)

### Take a tour of the Lens Protocol ecosystem.

![https://lens.xyz/](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 9.43.28 PM.png>)

Let's start by taking a look at what Lens Protocol has to offer!

If you visit the [Lens website](https://lens.xyz/), you'll see two links immediately.

* **Developer Garden** - takes you to documentation and guides
* **Join Discord** - takes you to the community chat server

We'll visit the Developer Garden in a second, but before we do that, let's check out the menu bar options in the top right.

![You can check out Apps that are already being built by the community!](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 9.45.21 PM.png>)

Here, I'll draw your attention to two things:

1. **Claim Handle** - As of now (7/13/2022), Lens Protocol is still in open beta, so you'll need to get allowlisted in order to claim a handle for your wallet address. Luckily, if you've been following the Road To Web3 community program and have earned Proof of Knowledge NFTs in the past, you're likely to be allowlisted already! If not, please come into the [Alchemy Discord](http://alchemy.com/discord) and ask about it in the [#week-10](https://discord.com/channels/735965332958871634/996103339416768593/996103993564610661) channel.&#x20;
2. **Apps** - This link takes you to a list of community-built web applications, including ones like Lensfrens, Lenster, Phaver, Alps Finance, Refract, and more.

{% embed url="https://twitter.com/thatguyintech/status/1546561239756615680?s=20&t=bOpORVUqpwsYAIUco3eMmg" %}

I want to take a quick moment to illustrate the power of Lens Protocol.&#x20;

If you visit this profile page on lensfrens - [https://www.lensfrens.xyz/thatguyintech.lens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/thatguyintech.lens) - you'll see my account, which should look something like this:

![lensfrens](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 9.51.25 PM.png>)

Now if you visit this completely different web application Lenster - [https://lenster.xyz/u/thatguyintech.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/thatguyintech.lens) - you'll see me again, with the exact same profile data, except an entirely different experience, even including posts / comments / reactions from other profiles.

![Lenster](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 9.54.37 PM.png>)

Nothing super mind-blowing so far, but stick with me here.

Check out the other apps.

Phaver - Social mobile app with Lens support that ALSO lets you "stake" to curate other peoples' posts, thereby allowing people to earn money for their content.

![Phaver](../../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_7269.PNG)

Refract - It's like Hacker News, except all the links and posts that are shared here are powered by Lens Protocol.

![Refract](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 10.00.29 PM.png>)

These apps are all built by different people, different teams, with different user experiences and product goals.

BUT, all the underlying data is the same, as if they all shared the same database and APIs.

How can that be?

Turns out, a shared database and public API are exactly the fundamental idea of Lens Protocol. That's why this technology has so much potential.&#x20;

Every piece of data is an NFT.

Every post, every comment, every reaction, every FOLLOW. Each of these pieces of data is stored as a non-fungible token created by and controlled by you, the creator.

That means that the digital content and relationships we create as users are owned by us and can be taken to any application built on top of the protocol!

Now let's dig in!

### Set up a Next.js application and install Apollo

Open a command line. Use the `create-next-app` to start a project that will be named `road-to-lens`

```bash
npx create-next-app road-to-lens
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 11.35.02 PM.png>)

The generated repo will be called `road-to-lens`, and you should have the following directory structure:

```
thatguyintech@albert road-to-lens % tree -L 1
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”œâ”€â”€ styles
â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock
```

Let's also install our graphql client while we're here. We'll be using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/) to query Lens Protocol for data.

```
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

After this finishes, we can perform a sanity check by starting a local server and loading up the webpage:

```javascript
thatguyintech@albert road-to-lens % npm run dev

> road-to-lens@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - SWC minify release candidate enabled. https://nextjs.link/swcmin
event - compiled client and server successfully in 4.2s (169 modules)
```

Loading up http://localhost:3000 should give you a basic template page that looks like this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 12.09.06 AM.png>)

### Try Apollo GraphQL out on the index.js page with Recommended Profiles from Lens

Let's get acquainted with Apollo and GraphQL by loading recommended Lens profiles on the home page.

First, set up the Apollo provider to wrap our entire app so that we have access to methods like `useQuery` and `useMutation` later on.

Create a file in the top-level directory called `apollo-client.js`

```
thatguyintech@albert road-to-lens % touch apollo-client.js
```

We'll initialize a client here with the base url pointed at the [Lens Matic Mainnet API](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/api-links):

```javascript
// ./apollo-client.js

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
    uri: "https://api.lens.dev",
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

export default client;
```

With this GraphQL client initialized, we can import it in our `/pages/_app.js`file and use it to wrap our global app Component:

```javascript
// pages/_app.js

import '../styles/globals.css'
import { ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/client";
import client from "../apollo-client";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp
```

You can see here we've added the `<ApolloProvider client={client}>` as a wrapper. This gives our entire app superpowers -- everywhere else we'll be able to use utility methods like `useQuery` and `useMutation` to fetch data from the Lens API and to send updates as well.

One last update before we can check back on localhost. Let's update `/pages/index.js` to make a query to fetch Recommended Profiles from Lens:

```jsx
import { useQuery, gql } from "@apollo/client";

const recommendProfiles = gql`
  query RecommendedProfiles {
    recommendedProfiles {
          id
        name
        bio
        attributes {
          displayType
          traitType
          key
          value
        }
          followNftAddress
        metadata
        isDefault
        picture {
          ... on NftImage {
            contractAddress
            tokenId
            uri
            verified
          }
          ... on MediaSet {
            original {
              url
              mimeType
            }
          }
          __typename
        }
        handle
        coverPicture {
          ... on NftImage {
            contractAddress
            tokenId
            uri
            verified
          }
          ... on MediaSet {
            original {
              url
              mimeType
            }
          }
          __typename
        }
        ownedBy
        dispatcher {
          address
          canUseRelay
        }
        stats {
          totalFollowers
          totalFollowing
          totalPosts
          totalComments
          totalMirrors
          totalPublications
          totalCollects
        }
        followModule {
          ... on FeeFollowModuleSettings {
            type
            amount {
              asset {
                symbol
                name
                decimals
                address
              }
              value
            }
            recipient
          }
          ... on ProfileFollowModuleSettings {
          type
          }
          ... on RevertFollowModuleSettings {
          type
          }
        }
    }
  }
`;

export default function Home() {
  const {loading, error, data} = useQuery(recommendProfiles);

  if (loading) return 'Loading..';
  if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <div>
      Hello
      {data.recommendedProfiles.map((profile, index) => {
        console.log(`Profile ${index}:`, profile);
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>{profile.name}</h1>
            <p>{profile.bio}</p>
            <div>{profile.attributes.map((attr, idx) => {
              if (attr.key === "website") {
                return <div><a href={`${attr.value}`}>{attr.value}</a><br/></div>
              } else if (attr.key === "twitter") {
                return <div><a href={`https://twitter.com/${attr.value}`}>@{attr.value}</a><br/></div>;
              }
              return(<div>{attr.value}</div>);
            })}</div>
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```

We're doing a couple of key things with this change:

1. Define a GraphQL query called `RecommendedProfiles.`
2. Fetch a list of profiles by calling `useQuery` with the `RecommendedProfiles` query -> which gets returned in the `data` variable.
3. Display some profile information such as `data.profile.name`, `data.profile.bio`, and `data.profile.attributes`.

Go back to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) (make sure your local server is running), and then voilÃ¡, you should see this really simple list of profiles!

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 1.26.52 AM.png>)

Ugly, but cool right?&#x20;

If you want to pause here and do some more exploration, you can add a `console.log` statement in your `/pages/index.js` file to see some more of the data that's returned from the GraphQL query.

For example, by adding `console.log(data)` , you'll be able to pull up the developer console on your browser and see the profile data.

![Check out the RecommendedProfiles response in console, or on the developer docs](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 1.30.05 AM.png>)

We'll look at this data more later and clean up the page designs :)

and a reminder: all of that data is stored on the Polygon blockchain as NFTs!

What the Lens team is doing with their API is just indexing all the on-chain data so that it's easier for developers to fetch and build using the NFTs!

A quick sanity check at this point..&#x20;

Your directory structure should look something like this:

```bash
thatguyintech@albert road-to-lens % tree -L 2
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ apollo-client.js      <- we created this
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ api
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _app.js           <- we modified this
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.js          <- we modified this
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ vercel.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ styles
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Home.module.css
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ globals.css
â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock
```

### Let's make the profiles list look nicer

In this part we'll refactor our code to make it easier to navigate, AND we'll style our components so that the UI looks much cleaner.

Starting with the refactor:

Here's our new `/pages/index.js`

```javascript
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/client";
import recommendedProfilesQuery from '../queries/recommendedProfilesQuery.js';
import Profile from '../components/Profile.js';

export default function Home() {
  const {loading, error, data} = useQuery(recommendedProfilesQuery);

  if (loading) return 'Loading..';
  if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <div>
      {data.recommendedProfilesQuery.map((profile, index) => {
        console.log(`Profile ${index}:`, profile);
        return <Profile key={profile.id} profile={profile} displayFullProfile={false} />;
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```

We're moving the `recommendProfilesQuery` into a separate graphql document in a new folder you need to create called `queries`:

```bash
mkdir queries
touch queries/recommendedProfilesQuery.js
```

and then copy the `RecommendedProfiles` doc over to this file:

```javascript
// queries/recommendedProfilesQuery.js

import {gql} from '@apollo/client';

export default gql`
  query RecommendedProfiles {
    recommendedProfiles {
          id
        name
        bio
        attributes {
          displayType
          traitType
          key
          value
        }
          followNftAddress
        metadata
        isDefault
        picture {
          ... on NftImage {
            contractAddress
            tokenId
            uri
            verified
          }
          ... on MediaSet {
            original {
              url
              mimeType
            }
          }
          __typename
        }
        handle
        coverPicture {
          ... on NftImage {
            contractAddress
            tokenId
            uri
            verified
          }
          ... on MediaSet {
            original {
              url
              mimeType
            }
          }
          __typename
        }
        ownedBy
        dispatcher {
          address
          canUseRelay
        }
        stats {
          totalFollowers
          totalFollowing
          totalPosts
          totalComments
          totalMirrors
          totalPublications
          totalCollects
        }
        followModule {
          ... on FeeFollowModuleSettings {
            type
            amount {
              asset {
                symbol
                name
                decimals
                address
              }
              value
            }
            recipient
          }
          ... on ProfileFollowModuleSettings {
          type
          }
          ... on RevertFollowModuleSettings {
          type
          }
        }
    }
  }
`;
```

And then let's also create the `Profile` component that we introduced in the `index.js` page above ( `import Profile from '../components/Profile.js';)`

We should organize it into a new directory called `components`.

```bash
mkdir components
touch components/Profile.js
```

And then just copy this structure in:

```javascript
// components/Profile.js

import Link from "next/link";
export default function Profile(props) {
  const profile = props.profile;

  // When displayFullProfile is true, we show more info.
  const displayFullProfile = props.displayFullProfile;

  return (
    <div className="p-8">
      <Link href={`/profile/${profile.id}`}>
        <div className="max-w-md mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md overflow-hidden md:max-w-2xl">
          <div className="md:flex">
            <div className="md:shrink-0">
              {profile.picture ? (
                <img
                  src={
                    profile.picture.original
                      ? profile.picture.original.url
                      : profile.picture.uri
                  }
                  className="h-48 w-full object-cover md:h-full md:w-48"
                />
              ) : (
                <div
                  style={{
                    backgrondColor: "gray",
                  }}
                  className="h-48 w-full object-cover md:h-full md:w-48"
                />
              )}
            </div>
            <div className="p-8">
              <div className="uppercase tracking-wide text-sm text-indigo-500 font-semibold">
                {profile.handle}
                {displayFullProfile &&
                  profile.name &&
                  " (" + profile.name + ")"}
              </div>
              <div className="block mt-1 text-sm leading-tight font-medium text-black hover:underline">
                {profile.bio}
              </div>
              <div className="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-900">{profile.ownedBy}</div>
              <p className="mt-2 text-xs text-slate-500">
                following: {profile.stats.totalFollowing} followers:{" "}
                {profile.stats.totalFollowers}
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This `Profile` component accepts `props` as an input, and expects the `props` object to have a `profile` field that includes all the information we might want to display when we render the component.

While we're here, we added the profile picture and follower/following counts as well!

Now, once again, let's check our work. Checking our work often is a good habit because it allows us to catch bugs quickly :)&#x20;

Make sure your server is running:

```bash
thatguyintech@albert road-to-lens % npm run dev

> road-to-lens@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

And go visit localhost: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

You should see something like this:&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 3.52.59 AM.png>)

It's still not that good looking yet, but hey we have photos!

Before we finish this step, let's take advantage of the CSS we included in the `Profile` component.

If you've never used Tailwind CSS before, these tags:

`uppercase tracking-wide text-sm text-indigo-500 font-semibold`&#x20;

all come from the utility-first fundamentals of Tailwind's design ([see docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design)).

So really all we have to do here is install Tailwind, as per their [installation instructions:](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Copy these configs so that Tailwind knows which paths to load styles for in our project. We want everything in the `pages` folder and `components` folder to be covered, so we use these paths:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Now we wrap up by adding the Tailwind directives to our CSS file:

```css
/* ./styles/globals.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

And then re-start the server and see how it looks now!

![much better looking after styling with Tailwind CSS](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 4.03.55 AM.png>)

It looks amazing. Even has drop-shadows and everything :)&#x20;

****
