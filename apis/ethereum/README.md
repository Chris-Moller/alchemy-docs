# Ethereum API

For devs looking to build on testnets, the Ethereum Foundation will be winding down support for the Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Kovan networks after Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake model. To ensure that your testnet applications remain fully functional after the transition, we recommend using Goerli, which will remain unchanged.
