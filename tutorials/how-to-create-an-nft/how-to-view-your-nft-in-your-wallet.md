# How to View Your NFT in Your Mobile Wallet

_Estimated time to complete this guide: \~3 minutes_

Congrats! You've made it to the shortest and simplest part of our NFT tutorial series: how to view your freshly minted NFT in your virtual wallet. We'll be using Metamask for this example since it is what we used in the previous two parts.

As a prerequisite, you should already have Metamask on mobile installed, and it should include the account to which you minted your NFT â€” you can get the app for free on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202), or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask\&hl=en\_US\&gl=US) .

## Step 1: Set your network to Goerli <a href="#step-1-set-your-network-to-ropsten" id="step-1-set-your-network-to-ropsten"></a>

At the top of the app, press the _Wallet_ button, after which you'll be prompted to select a network. As our NFT was minted on the Goerli network, you'll want to select Goerli as your network.

## Step 2: Add your collectable to Metamask <a href="#step-2-add-your-collectable-to-metamask" id="step-2-add-your-collectable-to-metamask"></a>

Once you're on the Goerli network, select the _NFTs_ tab on the right and add the NFT smart contract address and the ID of your NFTâ€” which you should be able to find on Etherscan based on the transaction hash from your [NFT minted in Part II](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-a-nft-smart-contract/how-to-mint-a-nft) of our tutorial.

You may need to refresh a couple times to view your NFT â€”but it will be there! ðŸ˜„
