# Using Alchemy Notify/Webhooks

_**Looking for the instructions on how to create webhooks programmatically? Check out the page below!**_

Alchemy Notify works by using webhooks, a way for you to subscribe to events that occur on your application. This guide will walk through what webhooks are and how you can use them in order to get started with Alchemy Notify.

## What are Webhooks? <a href="#what-are-webhooks" id="what-are-webhooks"></a>

Webhooks are a way for users to receive notifications when an event occurs on your application. Rather than continuously polling the server to check if the state has changed, webhooks provide information to you as it becomes available, which is a lot more efficient and beneficial for developers. Webhooks work by registering a URL to send notifications to once certain events occur.

Webhooks are typically used to connect two different applications. One application is the "sender," which subscribes to events and sends them off to the the second "receiver" application, which takes actions based upon that received data. When an event occurs on the sender application it sends that data to the webhook URL of the receiver application. The receiver application can then send a callback message, with an HTTP status code to let the sender know the data was received successfully or not.

You can think of webhook notifications just like SMS notifications. The entity sending the message has your registered phone number and they send a specific message payload to that phone number. You then have the ability to respond confirming you have received it, creating a two-way communication stream.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Webhooks vs. WebSockets:**

The difference between webhooks and WebSockets is that webhooks can only facilitate one-way communication between two services, while WebSockets can facilitate two-way communication between a user and a service, recognizing events and displaying them to the user as they occur.
{% endhint %}

## Types of Webhooks

There are four types of webhooks to receive notifications for:

1. [Mined Transactions](using-notify.md#mined-transactions) (all networks)
2. [Dropped Transactions](using-notify.md#dropped-transactions) (all networks)
3. [Address Activity ](using-notify.md#address-activity)(all networks)&#x20;
4. [Gas Price](using-notify.md#gas-price) (V1 only, Ethereum)&#x20;

To see in depth explanations for each of the Alchemy Notify webhooks check out the [Using Webhooks](using-notify.md) guide.

### Webhook Format&#x20;

The following format applies to all webhooks.

### 3. Address Activity <a href="#address-activity" id="address-activity"></a>

The Address Activity Webhook allows you to track all ETH, ERC20 and ERC721 [transfer events](../../guides/eth\_getlogs.md#what-are-transfers) for as many Ethereum addresses as you'd like. This provides your app with real-time state changes when an address sends or receives tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are looking for historical activity, check out the [Transfers API](../transfers-api.md)!
{% endhint %}

#### Types of Transfers

There are three main types of transfers that are captured when receiving an address activity response.

**1. External Eth Transfers**

These are top level transactions that occur with a from address being an external (user created) address. External addresses have private keys and are accessed by users.

**2. Token Transfers (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)**

These are event logs for any ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 transfers.

**3. Internal Eth Transfers**

These are transfers that occur where the `fromAddress` is an internal (smart contract) address. (ex: a smart contract calling another smart contract or smart contract calling another external address).

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### **Note on** Internal Transfers

* Internal transfers are only available on the following networks:
  * ETH\_MAINNET
  * ETH\_GOERLI
  * ETH\_RINKEBY
* We do not include any internal transfers with call type `delegatecall` because although they have a "value" associated with them they do not actually _transfer_ that value (see[ Appendix H of the Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) if you're curious). We also do not include miner rewards as an internal transfer.
{% endhint %}

**Example Response**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="V2" %}
**Event Object:**

`event`: Object - address activity object

* `network`: Network for the event, can be `ARB_MAINNET`, `ARB_RINKEBY`, `MATIC_MAINNET`, `MATIC_MUMBAI`, `OPT_MAINNET`, `OPT_KOVAN,ETH_MAINNET`, `ETH_GOERLI`, `ETH_ROPSTEN`, `ETH_RINKEBY`, `ETH_KOVAN`
* `activity`: List of transfer events whose `from` or `to` address matches the address configured in the webhook. Events are included in the same list if they occurred in the same block, each transfer event has the following values.&#x20;
  * `fromAddress`: from address of transfer (hex string).
  * `toAddress`: to address of transfer (hex string). `null` if contract creation.
  * `blockNum`: the block where the transfer occurred (hex string).
  * `hash`: transaction hash (hex string).
  * `category`: `external`, `internal`, or `token`- label for the transfer
  * `value`: converted asset transfer value as a number (raw value divided by contract decimal). `null` if erc721 transfer or contract decimal not available.
  * `asset`: `ETH` or the token's symbol. `null` if not defined in the contract and not available from other sources.
  * `erc721TokenId`: raw erc721 token id (hex string). `null` if not an erc721 token transfer
  * `erc1155Metadata`: A list of objects containing the ERC1155 `tokenId` (hex string) and `value` (hex string). `null` if not an ERC1155 transfer
  * `rawContract`
    * `rawValue`: raw transfer value (hex string). `null` if erc721 transfer
    * `address`: contract address (hex string). `null` if `external` or `internal` transfer
    * `decimal`: contract decimal (hex string). `null` if not defined in the contract and not available from other sources.
  * `typeTraceAddress`: the type of internal transfer (`call`, `staticcall`, `create`, `suicide`) followed by the trace address (ex. `call_0_1`).`null` if not internal transfer. (note you can use this as a unique id for internal transfers since they will have the same parent hash)
  * `log` : log emitted for the `token` transfer event. `null` if `external` or `internal` transfer

### 4. Gas Price

The Gas Price Webhook allows you to receive a notification every minute when the Mainnet gas price rises above or drops below a certain threshold that you can select. It works by pulling the current gas prices from [ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info) every minute.

Gas prices typically fall in a range, where a lower gas price means that the transaction will take longer to be mined, and a higher gas price means that the transaction will be mined more quickly. The Execution Speed metric allows you to specify a metric in that range that you would like to receive notifications, corresponding to ETH Gas Station's [Price Type metric documented here](https://docs.ethgasstation.info/gas-price). For example, selecting an Average Execution Speed means that you will receive notifications when a gas price typically mined in under 5 minutes rises above or drops below your selected threshold

## Test Out Webhooks <a href="#test-out-webhooks" id="test-out-webhooks"></a>

There are many tools you can use to test out webhooks. In this guide, you will learn how to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), which allows you to test your webhooks locally.

To set up ngrok:

1. Sign up for a [free ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)
2. Install ngrok using [the ngrok guide](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) or if you are on macOS run: `brew install ngrok`
3. Connect your ngrok account by running: `ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`
4. Fire up your local forwarding tunnel: `ngrok http 80`

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-03-01 at 1.33.31 PM.png>)

Once you have a URL to test your webhook (in this case [https://461a-199-116-73-171.ngrok.io](https://461a-199-116-73-171.ngrok.io) from  the picture above), you can test using the following steps:

1. Navigate to your [Notify dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/notify)
2. Click "Create Webhook" on the webhook you want to test
3. Paste in **your unique URL** and hit the "Test Webhook" button

If you are using ngrok, you should then see the webhooks roll in here: [http://localhost:4040/inspect/http](http://localhost:4040/inspect/http)

## How to Set Up Webhooks <a href="#how-to-set-up-webhooks" id="how-to-set-up-webhooks"></a>

Setting up a webhook is as simple as adding a new URL to your application. There are two primary ways to activate Alchemy Notify.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTE:** If you need to add over 10 addresses to the address activity webhook, we recommend adding them through an API call. See our [Notify API Reference page](./#create-webhook) for more information on this.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Setting Up Webhooks from the Dashboard

Navigate to the Notify tab in your [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/notify)

1. Determine which type of webhook you want to activate
2. Click the "Create Webhook" button
3. Specify which app you wish to add notifications to
4. Add in your unique webhook URL, this can be any link that you want to receive requests at (your server, slack, etc.) \*\*Note that the webhook payload might not \*\*For instructions on how to set up Alchemy Notify programatically, check out the \*\*always be compatible for 3rd party integrations. \*\*
5. Test out your webhook by hitting the "Test Webhook" button to ensure it works properly
6. Hit "Create Webhook" and you should then see your webhook appear in the list!
7. Check your endpoint to see responses rolling through!

### 2. Setting up Webhooks Programmatically

See Notify API Page below:

{% content-ref url="./" %}
[.](./)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Webhook Signature and Security

If you want to make your webhooks extra secure, you can verify that they originated from Alchemy by generating a HMAC SHA-256 hash code using your unique webhook signing key.

### 1. Find your signing key

Navigate to the [Notify page](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/notify) in your dashboard, click on the three dots for the webhook you want to  get the signature for and copy the "signing key".&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-12-13 at 10.41.56 AM.png>)

### 2. Validate the signature received

Every outbound request will contain a hashed authentication signature in the header which is computed by concatenating your signing key and request body then generating a hash using the HMAC SHA256 hash algorithm.

In order to verify this signature came from Alchemy, you simply have to generate the HMAC SHA256 hash and compare it with the signature received.

#### Example Request Header

```http
POST /yourWebhookServer/push HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json;
X-Alchemy-Signature: your-hashed-signature
```

#### Example Signature Validation Function

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
function isValidSignature(request) {    
    const signingKey = 'Signing key from by Alchemy dashboard for your Webhook';
    const headers = request.headers;
    const signature = headers['x-alchemy-signature']; // Lowercase for NodeJS
    const body = request.body;    
    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', token) // Create a HMAC SHA256 hash using the auth token
    hmac.update(JSON.stringify(body), 'utf8') // Update the token hash with the request body using utf8
    const digest = hmac.digest('hex');     
    return (signature === digest); // If signature equals your computed hash, return true
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
import hmac 
import hashlib 
import json 
def isValidSignature(request):
     signingKey = 'Signing key from by Alchemy dashboard for your Webhook';
     headers = request['headers'];
     signature = headers['x-alchemy-signature'];
     body = request['body'];
     string_body = json.dumps(body, separators=(',', ':'))
     digest = hmac.new(
          bytes(token, 'utf-8'),
          msg=bytes(string_body, 'utf-8'), 
          digestmod=hashlib.sha256
     ).hexdigest()
return (signature == digest);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Questions&#x20;

### **Capacity Limit**

If you receive a capacity limit error, meaning you have exceeded your total monthly compute units, you should receive a response similar to the one below. You can upgrade your limits directly through the [Alchemy dashboard.](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/settings/billing)

```
{
  "app": "Demo",
  "network": "MAINNET",
  "error": "Monthly capacity limit exceeded. Upgrade your scaling policy for continued service.",
  "webhookType": "MINED_TRANSACTION",
  "timestamp": "2020-07-29T01:13:54.703Z"
}
```

### Webhook IP Addresses

As an added security measure, you can ensure your webhook notification originated from Alchemy by verifying that the event originated from one of the following IP addresses:

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTE:** This does not apply for test webhooks done through the Notify dashboard.
{% endhint %}

```
54.236.136.17
34.237.24.169
```

### What's the difference between Notify V1 and V2?

The changes in webhook V2 are mostly formatting and parameter name differences. Thus, the primary changes that will need to be made are how you process response payloads. Although V1 webhooks will still be supported, all net-new webhooks created after **Tuesday, April 26, 2022** will be V2, with the exception of [gas price webhooks](using-notify.md#4.-gas-price).&#x20;

Here is an overview of the changes from V1 to V2:

* `app` is replaced with `appId` field and is now under the `event` field
* `network` field is now under the `event` field
* `app` field is no longer there for Address Activity web hooks
* `webhookType` is renamed to `type`
* `timestamp` is renamed to `createdAt`
* `fullTransaction` is renamed to `transaction`, which is under the `event` field

### Why am I missing transactions in the response?

Double check that you are parsing the response payload correctly- remember, transactions are returned in a list! Transactions that are mined within the same block will be returned within the same `"activity"` list.

### Why am I seeing duplicate addresses for different webhook URLs?

If you've created multiple [address activity webhooks](using-notify.md#address-activity) under the same application you might see duplicate addresses in each of the webhooks. This is known behavior since webhooks are associated by app (api\_key) instead of by URL. &#x20;

There are two solutions to this:

1. If you want address activity webhooks with different webhook URLs you'll need to [create different apps](../../introduction/getting-started/#1.create-an-alchemy-key) for each of the distinct URLs
2. If you're fine with using the same webhook url for all addresses, you can simply add additional addresses to the list through the dashboard or via the [PATCH api endpoint](./#add-remove-webhook-addresses).&#x20;

### What are some best practices when using webhooks with a large number of addresses?&#x20;

When working with large address lists, we suggest that users assign no more than 50,000 addresses to each webhook. If you find yourself using many addresses, spin up a new webhook to ensure that you have a reliable and scalable system.
